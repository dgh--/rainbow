#Rainbow (Colour Picker App)

This is a colour picker app that I started writing in order to experiment with the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element, and to try and put into practice some of the more advanced JavaScript techniques that I've been reading about.  


TODO:

(1) Refactor JavaScript code, and comment it more extensively; having just
looked at it again after some three months, it isn't totally clear what's going on in parts.
(2) Write a backend for this using Python and Flask; have established that the jQuery AJAX function works using a PHP script as the backend. (Hopefully this won't take long.)
(3) Decide whether or not to remove this.
